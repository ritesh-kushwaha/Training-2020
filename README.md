# Training-2020
I have shared php codes of an ecommerce website , I have learned and made this website during online training on web development.
You can run this code locally just by doing 5 simple step...
Step -1 : - Download WAMP server in your windows(it may be 32 bit or 64 bit) --(https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
Step -2 : - Paste these php code files in your windows location C:\wamp64\www\yourWebsiteName(anyname eg. lifestyle).
Step -3 : - Type localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser and create a database ecommerces just after running the WAMP server.
Step -4 : - Now, export the ecommerces.sql in your MySQL databse(ecommerces) in phpmyadmin.
Step -5 : - Finally, Go to the browser of your PC and type localhost/lifestyle/index.php and perform the action as per your requirements.
